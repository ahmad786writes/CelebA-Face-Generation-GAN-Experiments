# CelebA Face Generation GAN

This project involves experiments with GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) for generating high-quality face images based on the CelebA dataset. 

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: CelebA dataset containing diverse face images.
- **Model**: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with custom architecture and enhancements.
- **Objective**: To generate realistic face images through adversarial training.

## Features

- Custom GAN architecture for high-quality face synthesis.
- Support for experimental configurations to optimize generation.
- Integration with CelebA dataset preprocessing and augmentation.
